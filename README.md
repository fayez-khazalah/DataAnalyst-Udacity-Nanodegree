# DataAnalyst-Udacity-Nanodegree-Project2
This is the second project for me while I am taking the Data Analyst Nanodegree program by Udacity. 

## Project Overview
In this project, we are asked to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.


## Why this Project?

In this project, we'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.


## What will I learn?
As mentioned by Udacity, after completing the project, we will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
